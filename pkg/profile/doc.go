// Package profile defines how to execute commands against sets of files.
//
// It provides support for hooks (pre/post execution commands), plugins (ad-hoc
// commands), and source filtering to determine which files should be observed
// by file watchers.
//
// It can also be used to define UI overrides for when the profile is matched.
